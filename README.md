# Competitive Tool for Super Smash Bros. Melee.

## A personal project by Jeffrey Chow

What does the application do?

This is an application tool for the competitive E-sports game Super Smash Bros. Melee. The
aims of this application are to:

1. Track tournament results of my favourite competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee competitors.
2. Rank competitors by recent performance in the past year.
3. Create tournament brackets (Single Elimination, Double Elimination, Group-Stage, etc.).
4. Provide player data, along with other statistics (Head-to-Head, Character Matchups, etc.).

Melee players, rank them by recent performance in the past year, provide player data, and
generate brackets based on their rankings. The tool's intention is to *expand the player
database to all players*, which will allow for easy tournament seeding and bracket maker for
tournament organizers. The statistics tracking component of the application serves as a
one-stop shop for that type of data that will be used by players, analysts, tournament
organizers, and community members in the Melee community.

The issue of tournament seeding, and end-of-year rankings for competitive players in Super
Smash Bros. Melee has been a yearly topic of debate. As a fan of the sport, I wanted to 
contribute to this grass-roots community and hopefully help tournament organizers seed and 
run tournaments more smoothly. Additionally, the player statistics can be used by community 
members to evaluate player performance and use the data to formulate their own player rankings.

## User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to create a 32-player tournament bracket based on player rankings.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new player to the player database.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the head-to-head statistics of two players.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the ranking of 32 players based on their performances in the past year.
